# JetBrains Coding Challenge

In this coding challenge, I was required to fine-tune and evaluate a small pre-trained model (gs://t5-data/pretrained_models/mt5/small) on a new task of predicting the language a given text is written in (e.g. using the 14 languages from XNLI dataset)

This project is using the TensorFlow T5 codebase, therefore I was asked to use [t5.models.HfPyTorchModel API](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/a08f0d1c4a7caa6495aec90ce769a29787c3c87c/t5/models/hf_model.py#L38).
